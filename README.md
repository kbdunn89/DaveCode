# ModifiedDietzReturn
There are two programs here, the main difference is that one opens with a terminal that will give you more info about the account that's being looked at. I also noticed that there's no day on the first entry. I didn't know if that meant the 1st or 31st, so I gave you an option to toggle. I also don't know when you'll want to calculate the account for, so you have options to calculate until the last entry, calculate as of the current date, or calculate with a custom date.

I set up the file to work on the format of the excel spreadsheet you sent me before. You can extend the data to be up to 99 entries right now, but I can add more if you need. Any blank row or row beginning with the 'YTD Return %' cell will denote the end of the entries. It should also accommodate all the columns that excel sheet has too. None of this is set in stone and I can change whatever. We can discuss it more in depth when we hangout, but I figured this will give you some time to play with it first. It's probably really buggy, so if you break it make a note of how.
